## Development Workflow Established

### **Critical Process**: TODO List Updates
**IMPORTANT**: Always update `DEVELOPMENT_TODO.md` immediately after completing any task by:
1. Changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for completed items
2. Adding ✅ checkmark and completion notes
3. Updating progress summary percentages
4. Documenting what was built/configured

This ensures accurate progress tracking and continuity between development sessions.
